This program helps you to control and click your mouse by not touching any keys!!
Just like in Iron Man, Tony Stark uses his hand to control things virtually.
It do the same thing with your mouse.

# Steps

Put the position of your hand with the index finger being at the top like when you count to one.
Then, move your index finger to move the mouse.
To click, you need to take out your middle finger like when you count two.
This might be difficult to do but you will get used to it.

# Important

Even though it works, the FPS is very low and there are still some lag when accesing the camera. So note this before running at your computer.
The version 2.0 is less laggy and super smoother!
